## Description
Alt is a library that facilitates the managing of state within your JavaScript applications. It is modeled after flux.

What is flux?
Flux is an application architecture for building complex user interfaces. It eschews MVC in favor of unidirectional data flow. What this means is that data enters through a single place (your actions) and then flow outward through their state manager (the store) and finally onto the view. The view can then restart the flow by calling other actions in response to user input.
