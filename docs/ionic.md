## Description
Build amazing native and progressive web apps with open web technologies. One app running on everything

Ionic Framework is an open source SDK that enables developers to build performant, high-quality mobile apps using familiar web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

Ionic is focused mainly on the look and feel, or the UI interaction, of an app. This means that it’s not a replacement for Cordova or your favorite JavaScript framework. Instead, Ionic fits in well with these projects, in order to simplify one big part of your app development process: the front-end. Check out “Where does the Ionic Framework fit in?” to get a good understanding of Ionic’s core philosophy and goals.
