## What is Handlebars
Handlebars.js is a popular templating engine that is powerful, simple to use and has a large community. It is based on the Mustache template language, but improves it in several important ways. With Handlebars, you can separate the generation of HTML from the rest of your JavaScript and write cleaner code.
