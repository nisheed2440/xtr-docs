## Description
A JavaScript toolkit that saves you time and scales with your development process. Provides everything you need to build a Web app. Language utilities, UI components, and more, all in one place, designed to work together perfectly.

Dojo Toolkit is an open source modular JavaScript library designed to ease the rapid development of cross-platform, JavaScript/Ajax-based applications and web sites.

The Dojo Toolkit is organized in several parts:

* dojo contains the core and most non-visual modules.
* dijit is a library of user-interface modules for widgets and layout.
* dojox holds assorted modules not yet considered stable enough to include in dojo or dijit.
* util includes build tools such as optimization, documentation, style-checking, and testing.

``` js
Foo = function(){
  // summary:
  //      Soon we will have enough treasure to rule all of New Jersey.
  // description:
  //      Or we could just get a new roommate. Look, you go find him. He
  //      don't yell at you.  All I ever try to do is make him smile and sing
  //      around him and dance around him and he just lays into me. He told
  //      me to get in the freezer 'cause there was a carnival in there.
  // returns:
  //      Look, a Bananarama tape!
