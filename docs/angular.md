## Description
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source front-end web application platform led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

Angular 2 conceptual model is an improvement over AngularJS in two main ways:

1. it improves many of its existing parts (f.i. like modules which are now standard ES6 modules)
2. it condenses the number of concepts within the framework into a more cohesive unit with less redundant components (*f.i. like unifying services and factories, and providing a much better way to create components/directives)
``` js
