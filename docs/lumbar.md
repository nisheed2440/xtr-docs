## Description
You can think of lumbar as a conditional compiler that targets platforms. However, it doesn’t rely on variables in your source code. There’s no #ifdef or #endifs. Rather you can include and exclude files by associating them with a platform. It uses a json file, lumbar.json, to describe project meta-data.

* It allows you to define multiple routers in your code.
* It pulls in your mustache or handlebars templates.
* It pulls in your stylus styles and generates css files.
* It outputs standalone javascript and css files.
* It wraps your code in the correct scope (module pattern), or not.

This is supported by Walmart
