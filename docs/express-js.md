## Description
ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites, web apps and back ends. With ExpressJS, you need not worry about low level protocols, processes, etc.
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is an open source framework developed and maintained by the Node.js foundation.
Unlike its competitors like Rails and Django, which have an opinionated way of building applications, Express has no "best way" to do something. It is very flexible and pluggable.
