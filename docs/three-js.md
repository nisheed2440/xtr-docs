## Description
Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface (API) used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL.

Three.js allows the creation of Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)-accelerated 3D animations using the JavaScript language as part of a website without relying on proprietary browser plugins. This is possible thanks to the advent of WebGL.

High-level libraries such as Three.js or GLGE, SceneJS, PhiloGL or a number of other libraries make it possible to author complex 3D computer animations that display in the browser without the effort required for a traditional standalone application or a plugin.
