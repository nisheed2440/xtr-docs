## Description
Sightly is a new templating engine and language implementation. Sightly endeavours to supersede JSP as scripting language for Apache Sling and CQ/AEM components and strives to clearly separate presentation and logic concerns. Security measures such as XSS prevention are automatically applied. Another major advantage of Sightly is that it is based purely on HTML5, thus allowing 3rd party agencies to focus on design related parts of a CQ/AEM project without CQ/AEM knowledge.
