## Description
Currying is a technique of evaluating function with multiple arguments, into sequence of function with single argument.

In other words, when a function, instead of taking all arguments at one time, takes the first one and return a new function that takes the second one and returns a new function which takes the third one, and so forth, until all arguments have been fulfilled.

That is, when we turn a function call add(1,2,3) into add(1)(2)(3) . By using this technique, the little piece can be configured and reused with ease.
